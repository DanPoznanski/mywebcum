In this Tutorial weâ€™re going to configure a Two-Tier Enterprise PKI with Microsoft Server 2019 intended for Lab use. The advantage of a Two-Tier Enterprise PKI Hierarchy is that clients only trust the Root CA.  So if a Subordinate server gets compromised the Root CA does not have to be replaced. During normal operation the Root CA will be offline and Certificate requests are handled by the Subordinate CA. The Root CA is a non-domain joined device and will only be turned on issue a certificate for the Subordinate CA or to update the  Certificate Revocation List (CRL).


 - Overview

- Setup  Standalone Root CA

- Setup  Enterprise Subordinate CA

- Setup Group policy

- Deploy Policy Templates

In this setup we are going to build this Lab setup.



Before you start with this tutorial create the following servers and install them with Microsoft Server 2019. In this tutorial we are only configuring the servers.

| Servername | 	OS | Role |	Notes |
| ---------- | --- | ---- | ----- |
|  DC01      | 	MS Server 2019 | Domain Controller |
|  OFFENT-CA01 | MS Server 2019 | Offline Standalone Root CA | non-domain joined |
| SUBENT-CA02 | MS Server 2019 | Online Enterprise Subordinate CA | Domain joined |




### Offline Root CA




#### Setup Offline Root CA

First we will create the `CApolicy.inf`. This is a configuration file that defines multiple settings that are applied to the root CA certificate and all other certificates issued by the root CA. This file needs to be created before the ADCS is installed on the root CA. For more information about the Syntax go here.

1. Start Powershell and type the following line and press **Enter**:
```
notepad c:\windows\capolicy.inf
```

2. Select **yes** to create the new file

3.  Because this is a lab setup I will only setup some basic settings for the Root CA. I will configure the following settings:

- Renewalinformation for the CA certificate.

- The validity period for the base CRL.

- Disable the AlternateSignatureAlgorithm 

- Disable the DefaultTemplates, these are not used because this is an offline CA.

For this lab I will use a random generated OID which is based on the Microsoft OID. Because these generated OID may not be unique you should request a private enterprise number at IANA (link). This number can be added to the CAPolicy.inf.

```
[Version]
Signature="$Windows NT$"

[Certsrv_Server]
RenewalKeyLength=4096 
RenewalValidityPeriod=Years
RenewalValidityPeriodUnits=20
CRLPeriod=Years
CRLPeriodUnits=1
AlternateSignatureAlgorithm=0
LoadDefaultTemplates=0
```

4. Save the file as **capolicy.inf** using **All files** and **ANSI** Encoding.

5. Now we the role can be added and configured. Start the Server manager and select **Add roles and features**

6. The **Add Roles and Features Wizard** will start, press **Next** to continue.
